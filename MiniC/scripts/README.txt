The scripts in this directory serve as an example how scripting can be used to
automate repetitive systems programming tasks. The provided scripts are for the
bash command interpreter, and they employ several standard Unix utilities to
achieve their aim.  You are invited to use, extend and share the scripts in
this directory with your colleagues.  However, every script is provided "as
is", without implied completeness or warranties of any kind. Use at your own
risk. ;-)
